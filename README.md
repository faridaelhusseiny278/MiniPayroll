# MiniPayroll
# Description
This project is an implementation of a mini payroll system in Java using object-oriented programming principles.
The system is used for managing the data of employees at a company and generating payroll process for each one. 
An employee has these attributes: ID, name, age, and salary. There are 2 types of employees: "engineer" and "trainee".

The salary could be fixed for trainees.
